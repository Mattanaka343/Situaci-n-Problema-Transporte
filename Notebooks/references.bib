&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mediante la utilización de datos provenientes de la tarjeta de transporte SUBE, se realizaron análisis en la red de autobuses que demostraron la fuerte reducción en el número de validaciones con tarifa plana durante la postpandemia, peligrando la sustentabilidad del servicio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

abstract = {Understanding the impact of household characteristics and land use attributes on household vehicle ownership and usage decision is an efficient way of crafting strategic approaches having negative impacts on private vehicle dependency toward a sustainable urban transportation system. This empirical study applied the Gaussian copula-based discrete-continuous choice model to develop an integrated household vehicle ownership and energy consumption model using the unique data sample of 1795 households gathered in 2017 through various areas in Metro Manila, Philippines. The findings necessarily reported that household income is the main factor of household vehicle ownership and energy consumption decision. Households with the presence of older and well-educated household heads are found to be willing to acquire more vehicles. Encouraging urban densification, improvement of road public transport line density, reduction of distance from a residential area to the shortest railway station, and increasing mixture of integral facilities in neighborhoods (i.e., hospitals, markets, schools, and recreation centers) have considerable contributions to build a metropolis with less private vehicle dependency. The developed model was then applied to simulate percentage changes of the vehicle fleet and energy consumption based on various scenarios, and the policy implications based on the empirical findings were also discussed to help policymakers.}

    abstract = { Activity-travel behavior differs between women and men. Previous researches dealing with gender differences mainly focus on travel in itself rather than the interaction between time-use pattern and travel mode choice. Based on the activity-travel survey data of Suzhou, China, multigroup structural equation modeling is adopted to explore the reason for gender-based differences in mode choice through comparing the interactions among sociodemographics, time-use pattern, and mode choice. The results indicate that gender-based differences do exist in mode choice. Women prefer traveling by bicycle while men prefer traveling by car in Suzhou. And compared to women, men's mode choice is not so easy to be affected by other travel modes. Besides, gender-based differences exist in the magnitude or the sign of the interrelations among socio-demographics, time-use pattern, and mode choice. It is better to explain gender-based differences in mode choice by including time-use pattern endogenously than through socio-demographics alone. Furthermore, the study shows that by examining the direct, indirect, and total effects in the model system simultaneously, we are able to better capture the differences in mode choice across genders and further able to understand the reason for those differences. Finally, some dedicated suggestions are presented for planners and government to ensure a healthy transportation system. }

ABSTRACT = {Entry into parenthood is a major disruptive event to travel behavior, and gender gaps in mobility choices are often widened during parenthood. The exact timing of gender gap formation and their long-term effects on different subpopulations are less studied in the literature. Leveraging a longitudinal dataset from the 2018 WholeTraveler Study, this paper examines the effects of parenthood on a diverse set of short- to long-term outcomes related to the three hierarchical domains of mobility biography: mode choice, vehicle ownership, spatial mobility, and career decisions. The progress of the effects is evaluated over a sequential set of parenting stages and differentiated across three subpopulations. We find that individuals classified as “Have-it-alls”, who start their careers, partner up, and have children concurrently and early, significantly increase their car uses two years prior to childbirth (“nesting period”), and they then relocate to less transit-accessible areas and consequently reduce their reliance on public transportation while they have children in the household. In contrast, individuals categorized as “Couples”, who start careers and partnerships early but delay parenthood, and “Singles”, who postpone partnership and parenthood, have less pronounced changes in travel behavior throughout the parenting stages. The cohort-level effects are found to be driven primarily by women, whose career development is on average more negatively impacted by parenting events than men, regardless of their life course trajectory. Early career decisions made by women upon entering parenthood contribute to gender gaps in mid- to longer-term mobility decisions, signifying the importance of early intervention.},
